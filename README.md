# PAH biodegradation

### Brief introduction
* Here, a PAH-degrading gene database was established, and a genome-centric phylogenetical distribution of PAH-catabolic genes in the NCBI database was investigated.

### Requirements
  * [HMMER: biosequence analysis using profile hidden Markov models](http://hmmer.org)
  * [Diamond: Accelerated BLAST compatible local sequence aligner](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)
  * [prodigal: Prodigal Gene Prediction Software](https://github.com/hyattpd/Prodigal)
  * [SeqKit: a cross-platform and ultrafast toolkit for FASTA/Q file manipulation](https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit)
